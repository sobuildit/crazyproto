Crazy ideas for electronics prototyping. Sometime we just have fun with it.

Projects:
Hex-SOT23 can we use hexagonal circuit traces to define a fixed layout to route a non-trivial circuit to a SOT23 footprint (e.g. NPN Bipolar transistor) such that the component placement alone defines the circuit?
